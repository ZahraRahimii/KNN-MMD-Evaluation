# KNN-MMD-Evaluation
This project contains the implementation and evaluation of two classification algorithms ; k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Minimum Mean Distance (MMD) on three datasets (Iris, Liquid, and Normal).

## Project Workflow:
* kNN with $k = 1, 2, 3$ using the **Leave-One-Out** method
* MMD classifier with:

  * Leave-One-Out for *Iris* and *Liquid* datasets
  * Standard testing on *Normal* dataset

All results are compared and analyzed to understand the performance of both methods across different data settings.
